# I analyze the performance of ARK Invest, an investment firm specializing in actively managed Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). My analysis is motivated by the broader debate over whether active investors can generate superior returns to passive funds. ARK Invest manages the largest actively traded ETF making it ideal to examine. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, ARK thrived, generating returns above 100% for all five of its ETFs: ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG), Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ), and Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). The fact that all of ARK’s funds performed well provides a compelling case in favor of skillful management. ARK focuses on disruptive innovation, seeking companies whose technologies will transform industries. ARK evaluates investments over a five-year horizon, backing companies that meet its required 15% annual hurdle rate. At this rate, a company's value will double every five years. In a disruption-filled year, ARK’s strategy paid off. Did ARK Invest exhibit superior stock-picking abilities, or did they get lucky?
